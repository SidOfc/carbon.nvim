Carbon.nvim uses Neovim's fantastic Lua API to provide an optimal tree view
of the parent working directory and synchronizes changes to the file system
automatically. It does not handle renaming/moving, <strike>creating</strike>, or <strike>deleting</strike>
files or folders (yet, [file / folder creation is already there](#creating-files-and-directories)
 as well as [file / folder deletion](#deleting-files-and-directories)).

## CHANGELOG

See the [releases](https://github.com/SidOfc/carbon.nvim/releases) page for more information.

## Installation

Install on Neovim 0.7.0 and up (latest nightly recommended) using your favorite plugin manager:

[vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

```viml
Plug 'SidOfc/carbon.nvim'
```

[Vundle.vim](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)

```viml
Plugin 'SidOfc/carbon.nvim'
```

[dein.vim](https://github.com/Shougo/dein.vim)

```viml
call dein#add('SidOfc/carbon.nvim')
```

[minpac](https://github.com/k-takata/minpac)

```viml
call minpac#add('SidOfc/carbon.nvim')
```

[packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)

```lua
use 'SidOfc/carbon.nvim'
```

[paq-nvim](https://github.com/savq/paq-nvim)

```lua
require 'paq' { 'SidOfc/carbon.nvim', ... }
```

## Configuration

Configuration can be supplied like this:

**init.vim**

```viml
lua << EOF
  require('carbon').setup({
    setting = 'value',
  })
EOF
```

**init.lua**

```lua
require('carbon').setup({
  setting = 'value',
})
```

These settings will be deep merged with the default settings. See
`:h carbon-settings-table` for a list of available settings. An
alternative option of calling this method also exists:

**init.vim**

```viml
lua << EOF
  require('carbon').setup(function(settings)
    settings.setting = 'value'
  end)
EOF
```

**init.lua**

```lua
require('carbon').setup(function(settings)
  settings.setting = 'value'
end)
```

This option is more flexible as you have full control over the settings.
You are free to modify them as you wish, no merging will occur.

See `:h carbon-setup` for a more detailed explanation on configuration.
See `:h carbon-carbon-setup` for documentation about the `.setup` method.

## Usage

Carbon comes with a few commands and mappings out of the box, each is described below:

### Commands

See `:h carbon-commands` for more detailed information about commands and their
customization options.

#### Carbon / Explore

| Command   | Alias      |
|:----------|:-----------|
| `:Carbon` | `:Explore` |

The `:Carbon` command replaces the current buffer with a Carbon buffer.
When `:h carbon-setting-keep-netrw` is `false` then NetRW's `:Explore`
command is aliased to `:Carbon`.

![Carbon / Explore command example](/doc/assets/carbon-explore.gif)

#### Lcarbon / Lexplore

| Command    | Alias       |
|:-----------|:------------|
| `:Lcarbon` | `:Lexplore` |

The `:Lcarbon` command opens a Carbon buffer in a split to the left of the
current buffer. When `:h carbon-setting-keep-netrw` is `false` then NetRW's
`:Lexplore` command is aliased to `:Lcarbon`.

![Lcarbon / Lexplore command example](/doc/assets/carbon-lexplore.gif)

#### Fcarbon

| Command    |
|:-----------|
| `:Fcarbon` |

The `:Fcarbon` command opens a Carbon buffer in a floating window. This
window can be configured using `:h carbon-setting-float-settings`.

![Fcarbon command example](/doc/assets/carbon-fexplore.gif)

### Mappings

See `:h carbon-plugs` for more detailed information about mappings and their
customization options.

#### Move root up

| Mapping      |
|:-------------|
| <kbd>[</kbd> |

Moves Carbon's root directory up one level and rerender. See `:h carbon-plug-up`
for more information and customization options. Accepts a **count** to go up
multiple levels at once.

![Carbon up example](/doc/assets/carbon-up.gif)

#### Move root down

| Mapping      |
|:-------------|
| <kbd>]</kbd> |

Moves Carbon's root directory down one level and rerender. See
`:h carbon-plug-down` for more information and customization options. Accepts
a **count** to go down multiple levels at once on compressed paths.

![Carbon down example](/doc/assets/carbon-down.gif)

#### Reset root

| Mapping      |
|:-------------|
| <kbd>.</kbd> |

Resets Carbon's root directory back to the directory Neovim is opened with.
See `:h carbon-plug-reset` for more information and customization options.

![Carbon reset example](/doc/assets/carbon-reset.gif)

#### Edit file or toggle directory

| Mapping          |
|:-----------------|
| <kbd>enter</kbd> |

When on a directory, expand or collapse that directory. When on a file, edit
that file in the current buffer and hide Carbon. This mapping works differently
when Carbon is opened with `:Lcarbon`. See `:h carbon-plug-edit` for more
information and customization options.

![Carbon edit example](/doc/assets/carbon-edit.gif)

#### Edit file in horizontal split

| Mapping                      |
|:-----------------------------|
| <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd> |

Does nothing when on a directory. Edit a file in a new horizontal split. See
`:h carbon-plug-split` for more information and customization points.

![Carbon split example](/doc/assets/carbon-split.gif)

#### Edit file in vertical split

| Mapping                      |
|:-----------------------------|
| <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>v</kbd> |

Does nothing when on a directory. Edit a file in a new vertical split. See
`:h carbon-plug-vsplit` for more information and customization points.

![Carbon vsplit example](/doc/assets/carbon-vsplit.gif)

#### Close a Carbon buffer

| Mapping      | Alias             |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| <kbd>q</kbd> | <kbd>escape</kbd> |

Close a Carbon buffer, useful for closing Carbon buffers which were
opened with [`Fcarbon`](#fcarbon) or [`Lcarbon`](#lcarbon--lexplore).

![Close Carbon buffer example](/doc/assets/carbon-quit.gif)

### Creating files and directories

| Mapping      |
|:-------------|
| <kbd>c</kbd> |

![Creating files and directories example](/doc/assets/carbon-create-action.gif)

Enters an interactive mode in which a path can be entered. When
done typing, press <kbd>enter</kbd> to confirm or <kbd>escape</kbd>
to cancel. Prepending a `count` to <kbd>c</kbd> will select the `count`_nth_
directory from the left as base. See `:h carbon-buffer-create` for more details.

#### Deleting files and directories

| Mapping      |
|:-------------|
| <kbd>d</kbd> |

![Deleting files and directories example](/doc/assets/carbon-delete-action.gif)

Prompts confirmation to delete the current entry under the cursor. Press <kbd>enter</kbd>
to confirm the currently highlighted option, <kbd>D</kbd> to confirm deletion directly,
or <kbd>escape</kbd> to cancel. Prepending a `count` to <kbd>c</kbd> will select
the `count`_nth_ directory from the left as base. See `:h carbon-buffer-delete`
for more details.

## Why use Carbon.nvim instead of NetRW

While Carbon.nvim does replace NetRW by default, it can live side by side
with NetRW without any issues. See `:h carbon-setting-keep-netrw` for more
information. Additionally, while there is some feature overlap between
Carbon.nvim and NetRW, NetRW supports more features and scenarios.
Carbon.nvim is merely a local directory tree viewer. Below a subjective
list of relevant differences:

Some main features that NetRW offers which Carbon.nvim does not:

- Remote file system support
- The ability to handle renaming/moving, <strike>creating</strike>, or <strike>deleting files or folders</strike> (work-in-progress)
- A ton of commands and mappings I haven't bothered looking into yet

Some main features that Carbon.nvim offers which NetRW does not:

- Has a [floating window mode](#fcarbon)
- Automatically reflects changes to the file system in the buffer
- Compresses deeply nested child paths like GitHub does, but even better!
